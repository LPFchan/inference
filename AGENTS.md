# Agent Instructions

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical editable agent-instructions file. It enforces repo behavior while deferring canonical policy to `records/REPO.md`.

## Read First

- `records/REPO.md`
- `records/SPEC.md`
- `records/STATUS.md`
- `records/PLANS.md`
- `records/INBOX.md`
- `skills/README.md`

Before writing into an artifact directory, read its `README.md` and follow its prescriptive shape when it defines one.

Migration contracts, plans, and baselines are dissolved into `records/SPEC.md`, `records/STATUS.md`, `records/PLANS.md`, `records/decisions/`, and `records/research/`. Read those instead. The legacy `MIGRATION_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` is retired.

The build repo is `https://github.com/TheTom/llama-cpp-turboquant.git`, pinned to SHA `2f2f32f5d9517518c9e860f30131acb09840a965` (branch `feature/turboquant-kv-cache`). Patches in `patches/atomic-llama-cpp/` apply at image build time (`GRIMOIRE_LLAMA_CPP_APPLY_PATCHES=1`): PEFT trainable-token replacements (eastself), the Gemma4V multi-image mtmd fix, and Muse Glimmer support (upstream PR #26841: muse-glimmer arch + mmproj + DFlash draft).
The DFlash named there is upstream llama.cpp's speculative architecture (`MODEL_ARCH.DFLASH`, `MuseGlimmerAssistant`), not the retired grimoire DFlash/PFlash stack removed in DEC-20260902-001. Do not strip it from the patch. No registered model currently uses it, and `speculative-type` accepts only `nextn` and `mtp`, so enabling a Muse Glimmer drafter would need that allowlist extended first.

The webui is a git submodule at `webui/` — a forked copy of `ggerganov/llama.cpp`'s `tools/ui/`. Before building, run `git submodule update --init` to check it out.

## Skills

Load the skill before the trigger condition fires. Each skill defines the procedure; follow it.

| Trigger | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| Before creating a normal commit | `skills/commit-generator/SKILL.md` |
| Before replacing, deleting, or rewriting content that already exists | `skills/clean-correction/SKILL.md` |
| When routing work or creating repo artifacts | `skills/repo-orchestrator/SKILL.md` |
| When reviewing inbox pressure | `skills/daily-inbox-pressure-review/SKILL.md` |
| When reviewing upstream changes | `skills/upstream-intake/SKILL.md` |
| When sharpening or iteratively refining an artifact | `skills/sharpen-the-tip/SKILL.md` |
| When prototyping, greenfield building, or working pre-MVP | `skills/prototype-mode/SKILL.md` |

## Rules

- Keep durable truth in repo files, not only in external tools.
- Route work using the routing ladder in `records/REPO.md`.
- Preserve the boundary between `records/SPEC.md`, `records/STATUS.md`, `records/PLANS.md`, `records/INBOX.md`, `records/research/`, `records/decisions/`, commit-backed `LOG-*`, and `records/upstream-intake/`.
- Worker agents produce evidence, proposals, and compliant `LOG-*` commits. The orchestrator or operator owns truth-doc updates unless the operator explicitly allows otherwise.
- Treat `records/INBOX.md` as pressure, not a backlog. Cluster capture; promote only survived triage.
- Promote sparsely. Do not mirror one thought into research, decisions, plans, spec, status, upstream, and execution records.
- Every normal commit must be created from a skeleton registered by `scripts/new-commit-message.sh` and must pass local and remote provenance checks.
- Follow the stable-ID and provenance rules in `records/REPO.md`.
- Do not put `LOG-*` ids inside `artifacts:`.
- Do not invent a document shape when the repo already provides a canonical surface, directory `README.md`, or template.
- Do not promote exploratory debate into truth docs or decisions until there is a concise accepted outcome.
- Do not turn an inbox review into a digest of every low-confidence idea. Report counts or clusters.
- Do not write chatty transcripts where the repo expects normalized records.
- Do not bypass commit provenance checks unless the commit is an explicit bootstrap or migration exception.
- **Never use `docker commit` on the grimoire image.** Image changes go through `Dockerfile` → `docker compose build`. For live dev code changes, use the existing `DEV_SRC_BIND` mount. For dependency changes, edit `pyproject.toml` and rebuild.

## Code Review Rules

- Before reporting a commit as missing required provenance fields, verify against the exact commit messages as they exist on GitHub. If the fields are present, do not claim they are missing.
- The provenance contract is defined in `records/REPO.md` and enforced by `scripts/new-commit-message.sh`. Cite the specific field that is missing and the rule it violates; do not review commits against an assumed format.
