# Inference

This repository contains the Grimoire inference backbone. Its OpenAI-compatible
gateway runs on the grimoire host and serves local llama.cpp models there plus
remote vLLM models on Mangchi.

```
client ──/v1──► chat.lost.plus ──► grimoire :9001 ──┬── local llama.cpp GPU
                                                     └── mangchi vLLM over lost.plus
```

## Quick Start

```bash
docker run --name grimoire --gpus all -p 9001:9001 \
  -e GRIMOIRE_API_KEY="change-me" \
  -v /path/to/models:/models \
  -v grimoire-state:/var/lib/grimoire \
  grimoire:local --model qwen-3.6-27B
```

CLI management:

```bash
docker exec grimoire grimoire list                    # registered models
docker exec grimoire grimoire ingest --alias X --url Y  # download + register
docker exec grimoire grimoire pin gemma-4-31B 1        # pin to GPU
docker exec grimoire grimoire unpin gemma-4-31B        # release
curl -X POST http://localhost:9001/switch/qwen-3.6-27B -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

- `models` — model definitions; `gpu-ids` optionally assigns one ordinary llama-server process to an ordered list of physical GPUs
- The first `gpu-ids` member is the primary physical GPU reported by the backward-compatible `gpu` field. llama.cpp defaults to layer splitting; `extra-args` may set `--tensor-split` proportions in the same visible-device order.
- `gpu-ids` is initially incompatible with `cpu-only` and `vram-budget-mib`
- `fixed` — alias → GPU ID (pinned, never evicted); for a model with `gpu-ids`, the fixed ID must equal the first member
- `predict` — maximum generated tokens passed to llama-server; `-1` means no separate output cap, so generation is limited by the model context and stop conditions

Temporary runtime controls are available through admin-authenticated POST requests. They live only in manager memory, never change the registry or preset state, and clear on restart:

```bash
curl -X POST "$GRIMOIRE_ORIGIN/models/qwen/clone" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRIMOIRE_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"gpu_ids":[0,1],"tensor_split":[1,1]}'
curl -X POST "$GRIMOIRE_ORIGIN/models/qwen/declone" -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRIMOIRE_API_KEY"
curl -X POST "$GRIMOIRE_ORIGIN/models/qwen/pin" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRIMOIRE_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"gpu":0}'
curl -X POST "$GRIMOIRE_ORIGIN/models/qwen/unpin" -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRIMOIRE_API_KEY"
```

`clone` runs one llama-server process sharded across the ordered GPUs; it does not create a replica. Clone/declone reload active models with rollback on failure. Pin reloads only when residency must move; unpin changes eviction protection without moving a running model. `/status` keeps `gpu`/`gpus` for actual residency and reports requested placement, placement/pin sources, and runtime overrides separately. Locked presets clear runtime overrides and reconcile target models; manual-control presets retain them but enforce their GPU mask.
- Dynamic allocation: free GPU preferred, oldest non-pinned evicted when all busy
- `backend: "llama"` starts a local llama-server and participates in Grimoire's GPU allocator.
- `backend: "vllm-remote"` asks the Mangchi residency agent to load or unload `remote-model-id`, forwards inference to `remote-url`, and does not consume or evict Grimoire GPU residency.
- Grimoire keeps the public API key boundary. Mangchi's agent accepts only its configured private source CIDRs and does not receive the client credential.

### Prompt Cache Reuse

Grimoire applies `reasoning_effort` and Muse Glimmer's `reasoning_strength` from model `--chat-template-kwargs` to each request. Model aliases that produce the same llama-server command share one running process, so changing reasoning level keeps the existing KV cache. Other template defaults are merged into one startup argument.

The web UI pre-encodes the final conversation branch after each response, including reasoning and tool messages. This keeps the next user turn aligned with the serialized prompt already in the server cache. The production Compose profile reserves 4 GiB per llama-server process for its RAM prompt cache through `LLAMA_ARG_CACHE_RAM`.

### KV Cache Store (Content-Hash)

Content-hash KV caching replaces the legacy snapshot daemon. On every decode, the gateway saves a content-addressed KV persist to RAM (tmpfs) with async disk mirroring. On the next request with the same system prompt prefix, the cached KV is restored directly — no daemon round-trip.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `kv-cache-disk-dir` | Persistent KV cache directory |
| `kv-cache-ram-budget-mb` | Max tmpfs usage before LRU eviction |
| `kv-cache-disk-budget-mb` | Max disk usage before LRU eviction |
| `kv-cache-ttl-hours` | Entry TTL in hours (default 168 = 7 days) |

Content-hash deduplication means two conversations with the same system prompt share a single cached KV entry, skipping re-prefill entirely.

### Speculative Decoding

Two modes, both driven by `speculative-type` in the model config:

- `nextn` — Qwen models whose MTP layers live in the same GGUF. The server
  auto-detects them, so no separate draft model is loaded.
- `mtp` — Gemma4 models with a separate assistant GGUF, passed via `mtp-head`.

Both emit `--spec-type draft-mtp`. Any other value is rejected at validation
rather than silently ignored, because the launcher would otherwise load an
ordinary non-speculative model that looks like it worked.

DFlash and PFlash were retired in DEC-20260902-001.

## Building

```bash
git clone --recursive <repo> ~/inference
cd ~/inference
docker compose build        # ~90 min first build (llama.cpp)
```

## Systemd

```bash
sudo install -d /etc/grimoire
sudo install -m 600 /dev/stdin /etc/grimoire/grimoire.env <<'EOF'
GRIMOIRE_API_KEY=change-me
GRIMOIRE_ADMIN_TOKEN=change-me
GRIMOIRE_LEGACY_STATS_PATH=/var/lib/grimoire/token-stats.json
EOF
sudo install -m 644 etc/grimoire.service /etc/systemd/system/grimoire.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now grimoire.service
journalctl -t grimoire -f
```

`docker run --rm` per restart. State in `grimoire-state` volume. Logs via `--log-driver=journald`.

## Ingest

HTTPS-only, rejects private hosts, atomic writes, size-limited.

| Env | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GRIMOIRE_INGEST_MAX_BYTES` | 80 GiB | Max download size |
| `GRIMOIRE_ALLOW_HTTP_INGEST=1` | off | Allow plain HTTP |
| `GRIMOIRE_ALLOW_PRIVATE_INGEST=1` | off | Allow private/loopback |

## Stats

`GET /stats` — per-key totals. `GET /stats/global` — admin auth required.

Legacy import (`GRIMOIRE_LEGACY_STATS_PATH=/path/to/token-stats.json`) is idempotent. Appended to `/var/lib/grimoire/usage.sqlite3`.

## Dashboard

Its own site at `https://dash.lost.plus/`, built from `dash/` (see `dash/README.md`).
Static files; it reads `GET /stats/dashboard` and `PUT /stats/card-order` from the
browser and holds no state. Runs as the `dash` compose service on host port 9002.

It does not ask for an API key: its nginx proxies `/stats/` to the gateway and
attaches the key server-side, so the browser never holds a credential. That makes
the hostname itself the only gate — anyone who can reach it reads your usage and
cost figures. `GRIMOIRE_CORS_ORIGINS` is no longer needed for the dashboard.

### Telemetry storage

`state/telemetry.sqlite3` keeps raw samples every 5s plus a tiered rollup
(`system_rollup`, storing sum and count per bucket) at 60s and 3600s. Each query
reads the coarsest tier whose buckets divide its bins evenly, falling back
through finer tiers and finally raw samples for the newest stretch not yet
folded up. The dashboard only draws 60 points, so this costs no visible
resolution — and because bins and buckets nest, the aggregate reproduces the raw
averages exactly.

Payloads are built on a worker thread and cached for a fraction of one bin, so
`/stats` can never stall the chat event loop.

Full render, 15 series, on a 1.3 GB / 18.3M row database:

| Window | Tier | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5m, 15m | raw | ~5 ms |
| 1h, 6h, 24h | 60s | 4–11 ms |
| 7d | 60s | 45 ms |
| 30d | 3600s | 9 ms |
| all | 3600s | 18 ms (was 15,310 ms) |

7d stays on the per-minute tier deliberately: its bins are 2.8 hours, which the
hourly bucket does not divide evenly, so using it would smear values across bin
edges. The lifetime window has no natural alignment at all, so the endpoint
widens it until its bins are a whole number of hours — the graph starts slightly
before the first sample, and in exchange stays exact.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GRIMOIRE_TELEMETRY_INTERVAL_S` | `5` | Sampling interval |
| `GRIMOIRE_TELEMETRY_RETENTION_DAYS` | `0` (keep all); set to `30` in the fleet | Prunes **raw** samples only; rollups are never pruned, so lifetime graphs survive. Pruning is clamped to the rollup watermark, so it can never drop an unfolded sample |
| `GRIMOIRE_CORS_ORIGINS` | empty | Comma-separated browser origins allowed to read `/stats` cross-site |

First start after adding the rollup backfills it in chunks (~21s for a 1.3 GB,
18M-row database) while the sampler keeps running.

## Chat UI

Forked llama.cpp SvelteKit webui at `https://chat.lost.plus/` (submodule at `webui/`). Router-mode API: `GET /props`, `GET /v1/models`, `POST /models/load`, `POST /models/unload`.

The dashboard used to live here as `src/routes/dashboard/`. It moved to its own
site (see above) to keep this fork closer to upstream — DEC-20260830-001.

`GET /v1/models` includes registry capabilities plus `input_modalities` and
the configured native reasoning advertisement. Multimodal aliases advertise
`["text", "image"]`; aliases without a configured reasoning kwarg advertise
reasoning as unsupported. Native alias levels are kept verbatim.

`GRIMOIRE_WEBUI_DIR` overrides asset path.

### Server-Side History

The `webui/src/lib/services/database.service.ts` replaces IndexedDB with HTTP to `/history` (tree-aware: branches, forks, cascade delete). Per `user_hash` (SHA-256 of API key).

| Method | Path |
| --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/history` — list conversations |
| `POST` | `/history` — create/upsert |
| `GET` | `/history/{id}` — conversation + tree |
| `PATCH` | `/history/{id}` — update |
| `DELETE` | `/history/{id}?with_forks=true` — delete + cascade forks |
| `POST` | `/history/{id}/messages` — create branch |
| `PATCH` | `/history/messages/{id}` — update message |
| `DELETE` | `/history/messages/{id}` — delete message |
| `DELETE` | `/history/{id}/messages/{id}?cascade=true` — cascade delete |
| `POST` | `/history/{id}/fork` — fork at message |
| `POST` | `/history/import` — bulk import |

## Drop-In Cutover
