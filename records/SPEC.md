# Project Spec

**Project:** Grimoire — Multi-host model serving gateway
**Canonical repo:** `git@github.com:LPFchan/inference.git`
**Operator:** LPFchan
**Last updated:** 2026-09-10

## Mission

Migrate the served DFlash/PFlash stack onto the canonical `Anbeeld/beellama.cpp` (Bee) base.

### Workstreams

- **A**: Canonical DFlash decode on Bee.
- **B**: DFlash `compact-full` persistence parity for `dflash-qwen3.6-27B`.
- **C**: Preserved llama-side PFlash path, including its `.kv` slot contract, warm/cold behavior, and text-only reconstruction semantics.
- A, B, and C are not validation-independent. Changes to prompt layout, effective prompt semantics, or snapshot formats can invalidate multiple tracks at once.

## Required Decisions

These decisions were locked before Phase 1 and are not subject to renegotiation without a deliberate operator override:

- Retirement target is A + B + C. Decode-only cutover is not allowed.
- `compact-full` parity is required.
- DFlash remains text-only for this migration.
- Served `pflash-qwen3.6-27B` is text-only. Do not carry multimodal behavior or `mmproj` wiring for this model into the migrated stack.
- GGUF is the target end-state for DFlash draft artifacts, but the served artifact flip happens only after the canonical path is proven.
- Bee is the canonical engine.
- Standalone PFlash packaging is the default first target.
- The llama-side PFlash path keeps the current token -> text -> message reconstruction flow after compression. Direct prompt/token integration is out of scope.
- VMM-based park/unpark is preferred only if isolated measurement proves the gain. SIGTERM/page-cache reload behavior is fallback.
- Full removal of `/opt/dflash` is required for the final served runtime, not just normal-llama decoupling.

## Served Contracts

### Contract A: DFlash Decode
| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Primary served model | `dflash-qwen3.6-27B` |
| Target artifact | `gguf/Qwen3.6-27B-Q4_K_M.gguf` |
| Draft artifact | `gguf/dflash-draft-3.6-q8_0.gguf` |
| Semantics | Text-only chat, `parallel=1`, `ctx-size=60000`, `max-effective-context=60000`, `budget=18`, `cache-type-k=q8_0`, `cache-type-v=q8_0`, `fa-window=2048`, `<|im_end|>` stop |
| Prompt handling | Block-aware; compression boundaries/message metadata/prompt layout must survive `_prompt_layout_from_messages` -> compression -> reconstruction |
| Retirement | Final served decode path must not require the Lucebox decode daemon |

### Contract B: DFlash compact-full Persistence
- `snapshot-mode=compact-full` is required. Not optional.
- Session restore keyed by `conversation_id`, validated against effective prompt prefix hash.
- Transient staging slot contract, currently `snapshot-staging-slot=7`.
- Prompt-boundary inline snapshot behavior for reusable prefix work.
- RAM-first snapshot writes with asynchronous disk mirroring, manifest persistence, disk TTL, and RAM/disk budget enforcement.
- Stale-session invalidation on prompt-prefix mismatch. Silent reuse of stale snapshots is a hard failure.
- Support for prefix-cache semantics even when `prefix-cache-slots=0`.
- Preserve all state for correct continuation: KV, recurrent/native state, and `target_feat` equivalents.

### Contract C: Preserved Llama-Side PFlash
| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Supported models | `pflash-qwen3.6-27B`, `pflash-park-qwen3.6-27B` |
| Daemon path | Standalone `pflash_daemon` until in-process replacement wins on measured TTFT/VRAM/startup |
| Warm/cold split | Preserved unless explicitly retired |
| Park/unpark | FIFO-based via `pflash_shim.so` |
| Slot contract | `/slots/0` save/restore; conversation-keyed `.kv` under `/dev/shm/grimoire-slots` |
| Compressor protocol | Raw `int32`: `compress <path> <keep_x1000>` |
| Drafter path | `Qwen3.5-0.8B Q8_0` |
| Reconstruction | Block-aware compression -> token -> text -> message. Direct prompt/token integration is out of scope. |
| Multimodal | Retired for this model |

### Contract D: Runtime Isolation
- End-state removes `/opt/dflash` entirely from served runtime image, startup environment, and runtime search path.
- Any remaining `/opt/dflash` dependency before cutover is temporary migration debt, limited to pre-cutover preservation work.
- The canonical non-PFlash llama path must be anchored on Bee libraries throughout the migration.

### Contract E: Reasoning-Alias Prompt Cache Reuse
- Aliases that differ only by request-time `reasoning_effort` or Muse Glimmer `reasoning_strength` share one running llama-server process and KV cache.
- Replica groups, fixed GPU placement, PFlash/drafter configurations, and unrelated command-equivalent aliases must remain separate.
- The requested alias's chat-template defaults, plugins, usage attribution, and history attribution apply to each request even when another alias owns the shared process.
- Each completed web UI turn carries its cache-routing ID in `x-grimoire-kv-conversation-id` and warms the final persisted branch for the next turn. Cache keys are scoped by running model and authenticated user, and the warm request uses the same context compaction as a real turn. This header stays separate from the legacy history-recording conversation ID; warm-only requests do not count toward usage. Aborted or empty turns are not warmed.
- The production llama-server RAM prompt-cache allowance is 4 GiB per process.

### Contract F: Public Capability Metadata
- `GET /v1/models` preserves the registry's `capabilities` field and adds
  `input_modalities`: `["text", "image"]` for multimodal/vision aliases and
  `["text"]` for other aliases.
- Reasoning aliases advertise their configured native request-only level in
  `reasoning.supported_efforts`, `reasoning.default_effort`,
  `reasoning.default_enabled`, and `reasoning.mandatory`. An alias without a
  reasoning kwarg advertises `reasoning.supported: false`.
- Malformed or conflicting reasoning kwargs produce an empty reasoning object;
  the gateway does not infer a level from an alias name or from another model.

### Contract G: Mangchi Remote Backends

- `chat.lost.plus` and the webui remain on Grimoire. Mangchi models appear in
  the same registry and use the same authenticated public API.
- A `vllm-remote` registry entry names a Mangchi residency-agent origin, the
  agent's model ID, the vLLM origin, and the backend's native model ID.
- Loading and unloading call Mangchi's residency agent. Inference is forwarded
  directly to the corresponding vLLM service without forwarding Grimoire API
  credentials.
- Remote models do not participate in Grimoire GPU allocation, eviction,
  pinning, cloning, or llama.cpp KV-slot persistence.
- Mangchi owns its unified-memory budget, LRU eviction, pinning, launch specs,
  and process health. Grimoire owns the public registry and client-facing state.

## Served Model Inventory

| Alias | Backend | Draft/Drafter | Capabilities | Harness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `qwen-3.6-27B` | llama | — | completion, multimodal | `test_e2e_smoke.py::LlamaCppSmokeTests` |
| `dflash-qwen3.6-27B` | llama (spec dflash) | `gguf/dflash-draft-3.6-q8_0.gguf` | completion (text-only) | `test_e2e_smoke.py` |
| `pflash-qwen3.6-27B` | llama (pflash) | `Qwen3.5-0.8B-Q8_0.gguf` | completion (text-only) | `test_pflash_pipeline.py` |
| `pflash-park-qwen3.6-27B` | llama (pflash+park) | `Qwen3.5-0.8B-Q8_0.gguf` | completion (text-only) | parameterized harness target only |

## Required Verification Suite

| Suite | File | What it covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KV cache store | `tests/test_kv_cache_store.py` | Content-hash RAM/disk tiering, LRU eviction, TTL, manifest persistence |
| Live smoke | `tests/test_e2e_smoke.py` | Basic chat completion on served models |
| Long-prompt compressor | `tests/test_pflash_pipeline.py` | PFlash compression pipeline |
| Soak/leak/snapshot-growth | `tests/test_stress_dflash.py` | Bounded RAM/disk growth |
| Runtime isolation | manual | Start `qwen-3.6-27B` without `/opt/dflash` in search path; verify no `/opt/dflash` symbols |
| Image audit | manual | Verify served runtime image does not ship `/opt/dflash` |

Hard floors: TTFT under 120s, decode TPS above 10, restore speedup >= 1.5x when first-turn TTFT > 2s.

Default regression budget: median TTFT no worse than +20%, median decode TPS no worse than -10%, no unbounded RAM/disk growth across stress run, no repeated-call compressor VRAM drift above 256 MiB after steady state.

## Required-vs-Retired Behavior Matrix

| Surface | Must Preserve | Explicitly Retired / Not A Gate Yet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dflash-qwen3.6-27B` served decode | Text-only chat semantics, `ctx-size=60000`, `cache-type-k=q8_0`, `cache-type-v=q8_0`, `spec-dflash-cross-ctx=1024`, content-hash KV caching | N/A — canonical path |
| `pflash-qwen3.6-27B` preserved PFlash path | Standalone `pflash_daemon`, raw `compress <path> <keep_x1000>` protocol, `Qwen3.5-0.8B Q8_0` drafter, token -> text -> message reconstruction | Multimodal serving and `mmproj` wiring |
| `pflash-park-qwen3.6-27B` preserved park path | FIFO park/unpark via `pflash_shim.so`, same text-only compression semantics as above | Global `/opt/dflash` library-path coupling |
 | `qwen-3.6-27B` normal llama path | Canonical non-PFlash startup, multimodal config, resolves against Bee libraries without `/opt/dflash` | Hidden fallback that only works because `/opt/dflash` is in runtime search path |
| `dflash-qwen3.6-27B` native canary | Dormant native-control-plane launch contract | Treating canary as served replacement before real-hardware decode verification |

## Final Gates

1. Canonical base is Bee (`Anbeeld/beellama.cpp`).
2. DFlash decode parity is green for `dflash-qwen3.6-27B`.
3. Content-hash KV caching parity is green (restart resilience, cross-conversation sysprompt reuse, bounded disk growth).
4. Preserved llama-side PFlash parity is green (.kv slot contract, warm/cold, reconstruction, all required native fixes).
5. `pflash-qwen3.6-27B` is text-only, no multimodal config or `mmproj` in served runtime.
6. Served runtime is verified without `/opt/dflash` dependencies or image content.
7. Every upstream input and served artifact is pinned by exact SHA.
8. Lucebox retirement is blocked until A + B + C are all green.
